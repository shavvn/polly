# Polly
Polly is a wrapper package of matplotlib that can easily generate plots charts and graphs. It could be used by academic writing and data visualization. 

## How to use it?

(currently only 2D bar plot works...)

- Plot a 2D bar graph from a csv file, simply do
```
python 2dbar.py --csv 2d_bar_sample.csv
```

or you if you have your *axes* object and params ready in your program, you can use
```
2dbar.plot(ax, params)
```

To be finished...
